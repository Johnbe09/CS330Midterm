In this Midterm Project, we built a website to help users find information about national parks.

The three APIs we used are:
1. National Park Service
2. Open Weather
3. Google Maps

Users select a state which populates a dropdown of all national parks in the state.
When they select a national park, they are provided a park description,
current park weather, a link to the park website, and the google map resets to 
a satellite view of the national park. If the park does not have a specific location,
(too large or spans several states), that is noted in the weather information
and the google map returns to the regular view of the USA.
